*******************

### **Dataset Understanding**

AltiQ hardware required some reports on sales analytics and finance analytics, so they given analytics team some requirement files. Now, this requirement file is given by Atliq business users to data analytics team. Now analytics team have to build reports using these requirement files. Those requirement files contains some sales CSV files, letâ€™s explore them.

**Fact table :** These tables store transactional or measurable data. We have the following fact tables: fact_sales_monthly, ns_targets_2021, fact_sales_monthly_with_cost.

**fact_sales_monthly**- This fact table contains monthly transactional-level data on product sales and associated costs, including quantity sold, net sales, freight charges, and manufacturing expenses.

| Column Name         | Description                                                                 |

### **Planning Before Report Building**

Before jumping into building the final reports, itâ€™s important to follow a structured, step-by-step approach. This ensures clarity, reusability, and a scalable reporting structure. In this project, we planned to build reports for Sales analytics and finance analytics.

#### **Sales Report :**

- **Project objective:**

   **1.** Create a _[customer performance report](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_ 

   **2.** Conduct a comprehensive comparison between _[market performance and sales targets](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/Market%20Performance%20vs%20Target%20Report.pdf)_

- **Purpose of sales analytics:** Empower businesses to monitor and evaluate their sales activities and performance.

- **Importance of analyzing sales data:** Identify sales patterns and track key performance indicators (KPIs).

- **Role of reports:** Determine effective customer discounts, facilitate negotiations with consumers, and identify potential business expansion opportunities in promising countries.

&nbsp;
#### **Finance Report :**

- **Project objective:** 

    **1.** Create Profit and Loss (P&L) reports by _[Fiscal Year](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/P%26L%20Statement%20by%20Fiscal%20Year.pdf)_ & _[Months](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/P%26L%20Statement%20by%20Months.pdf)_ 

   **2.** Create Profit and Loss (P&L) reports by _[Markets](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/P%26L%20Statement%20by%20Markets.pdf)_

- **Purpose of sales analytics:** Evaluation of financial performance, support decision-making, and facilitate communication with stakeholders.

- **Importance of analyzing Finance data:** Aid in benchmarking against industry peers and previous periods Foundation for budgeting and forecasting.

- **Role of reports:** Align financial planning with strategic goals Instill confidence in the organization's financial outlook.

There are other reports like _[Product Based Report](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/Product%20Based%20Report.pdf)_, _[Division Level Report](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/Division%20Level%20Report.pdf)_, _[Top and bottom products - QTY Report](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/Top%20and%20bottom%20products%20-%20QTY%20Report.pdf)_, _[New products - 2021 Report](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/New%20Products%20-%202021%20Report.pdf)_, _[Top 5 countries Report](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/Top%205%20countries%20Report.pdf)_ and _[GM% (sub_zone) Report](https://github.com/SouravBose2000/Excel-Sales-Analytics/blob/main/Project/PDF/GM%20%25%20by%20Subzone%20Report.pdf)_.
        
To prepare for these, we followed these steps:
- **ETL Process â€“ Extract, Transform, Load :**
The Atliq business team provided the analytics team with requirement files containing raw sales data in .csv format. These files include monthly transactional data from Atliq Hardwareâ€™s sales operations.We first imported the CSV files into Excel, which is known as the **Extract** step â€” this brings the raw data into our environment for further processing. Next, we used Power Query to clean, filter, rename columns, remove nulls, and apply business logic as needed â€” this is the **Transform** step, where we shape the data into a usable form. Finally, the transformed data was loaded back into Excel across structured sheets, ready for modeling and analysis in Power Pivot â€” this is the **Load** step.
- **Identify Report Components**
        - We first listed all the required components (fields/measures) needed for both reports. This helped us map which fields come from which table (e.g., sales data from the fact table, customer details from the dimension table).
- **Create dim_date Table**
        - The dataset didnâ€™t include a dedicated date dimension, so we created a dim_date table using Power Query. This date table allows for advanced time intelligence functions such as Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-over-Month (MoM), and more.
- **Build the Data Model**
        - Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report.
        - Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
        - In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.

#### **Market Performance VS Target Report**

The Market Performance Report provides a breakdown of net sales by market (country) for each individual year, allowing stakeholders to analyze how different countries have performed over time. This report includes 2021 sales targets and compares them against the actual net sales for 2021, highlighting the gap between target and performance.This report also displays the percentage variance from the target using conditional formatting, enabling quick identification of underperforming or outperforming markets.

In addition, this report also shows a comparison column (21 vs 20), which highlights the percentage change from 2020 to 2021 for each metric. This provides a quick view of year-over-year performance improvements or declines. Interactive filters for customer, market, division, and region allow users to slice the data and view financial performance from multiple perspectives.

*******************
### **Project Outcome**

By using this sales analytics report â€” specifically the **Customer Performance Report** and the **Market Performance vs Target Report** â€” it will help in answering key business questions such as:
- Which customers (e.g., Amazon, Croma) contributed the most to sales in past years?
- What was the year-over-year performance trend for each customer?
- How did each customer perform during peak seasons like Diwali, New Year, or Christmas?
- If a particular customer demands higher discounts, will it still be profitable for us overall?
- Which customers are eligible for performance-based bonuses or exclusive product access?
- Did each market (e.g., India, USA) achieve its monthly or annual net sales targets?
- Which markets underperformed and by how much?
- Are there markets consistently outperforming targets that may need capacity expansion?
- Which markets can be prioritized for launching new products based on past performance?

By using this Finance Analytics Report â€” specifically the **P & L by Fiscal Years Report**, **P & L by Fiscal Months Report** and **P & L Year (Markets) Report** â€” it will help in answering key business questions such as:
- How is the company performing financially at a monthly and yearly level?
- What is the gross profit margin, and how has it changed over time?
- Are we meeting our P&L targets set by the Finance department?
- How much are we spending on cost of goods sold (COGS), and is it under control?
- Is the business generating enough profit to support expansion or new investments?
- How does our performance compare with our strategic financial vision?
- Are the regional finance teams aligned with central finance in terms of financial reporting and decisions?
- Can we use this report during business reviews and executive meetings to back up decisions with data?

Furthermore, these reports will help in answering numerous 'why' questions based on different business situations and decisions can be taken based on the data.
